# AI-powered app store search

![](./video.gif)

This is a simple example to show how to build an AI-powered search engine for an app store using the [Jina](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/) framework. It indexes and searches a subset of the [17K Mobile Strategy Games dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tristan581/17k-apple-app-store-strategy-games) from Kaggle.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

- You have a Mac or Linux system
- You have Python 3.7 or later installed, and have some basic Python knowledge
- You understand basic git and terminal usage

### Clone this repo

```shell
git clone git@github.com:alexcg1/jina-app-store-example.git
cd jina-app-store-example
```

### Create a virtual environment

We wouldn't want our project clashing with our system libraries, now would we?

```shell
virtualenv env --python=python3.8 # Python versions >= 3.7 work fine
source env/bin/activate
```

### Install everything

Make sure you're in your virtual environment first!

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Increase your swap space (optional)

We're dealing with big language models and quite long text passages. Macs can apparently dynamically allocate swap space, but on Manjaro Linux I manually created and activated a swapfile. Otherwise my computer with 16gb of RAM will just freeze up while indexing.

```shell
# Don't bother if you're on a Mac or have loads of memory
cd /tmp
dd if=/dev/zero of=swapfile bs=1M count=10240 status=progress
chmod 600 swapfile
mkswap swapfile
swapon swapfile
```

You'll need to do this after every reboot. Or you can [read the instructions](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Swap#Manually) to mount it at startup.

### Download dataset

```shell
python get_data.py
```

This command creates a directory called `data` and downloads the [17K Mobile Strategy Games dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tristan581/17k-apple-app-store-strategy-games) into it. It then shuffles it to ensure we get a diverse range of apps to search through.

ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: We shuffle using a fixed random seed of `42`, so every shuffle will be the same. Want a different shuffle? Change it in [`backend_config.py`](./backend/backend_config.py)

### Index your data

```shell
python app.py -t index -n 1000
```

ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Use `-n` to specify number of apps to index

### Search your data

`app.py` accepts an input query via a REST gateway:

```shell
python app.py -t query_restful
```

### Start the front end

In another terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/alexcg1/jina-app-store-frontend.git
cd jina-app-store-frontend
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit app.py
```

Then open http://localhost:8501 in your browser

### Search from the terminal

```shell
curl --request POST -d '{"top_k":10,"mode":"search","data":["hello world"]}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 'http://0.0.0.0:45678/search'
```

Where `hello world` is your query.

The results should be a big chunk of JSON containing the matching apps. Or at least something close to matching. By default we're only indexing 1,000 apps from a list that's a few years old (since this is just an example) so don't be surprised if your search for a specific title doesn't come up.

ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: For cleaner formatting, pipe the contents of the above command into [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) by adding `| jq` to the end of the command.

## FAQ

### Why this dataset?

It contains a lot of metadata, including (working) links to icons. I want to build a nice front-end to show off the search experience so graphical assets are vital. Plus stuff like ratings, descriptions, the works.

### The download/purchase buttons don't do anything

This is just a demo search engine. It has no functionality beyond that. 

### How can I change basic settings?

Edit `backend/backend_config.py`

### What are all these files?

After cloning, downloading the dataset and indexing data, you'll see a lot of files. We're only concerned about the `backend` folder since that's where all the Jina magic happens. Don't worry if you don't see all of these right away. Sometimes they'll only appear after downloading the dataset or indexing.

You may also see several `__pycache__` folders with `.pyc` files. Don't worry about these. [They're explained here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/16869074) if you really want to know.
